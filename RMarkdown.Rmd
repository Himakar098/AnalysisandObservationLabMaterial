## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r  fig.cap = "Plot of pressure against temperature. \\label{pressure}"}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. The `fig.cap` option allows adding a caption to the figure. Adding a label so that you can refer to the figure in the document. So for example, Figure
\ref{pressure} shows a plot of pressure against temperature. It can be seen that pressure increases
exponentially with temperature.

Mathematics can be typesett using the \LaTeX\ syntax. For example,
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i= 1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \label{sumeqn}
\end{equation}
is the a formula for the sum of the first $n$ positive integers. 

Show that
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^n i^3 = \left(\sum_{i= 1}^ n i \right)^2, \label{sumcubes}
\end{equation}
that is, the sum of the cubes of the first $n$ positive integers is equal to the square of the sum
of the first $n$ integers.

Here is a linear model.
```{r} 
summary(Orange)
orange.lm <- lm(age ~ circumference, data = Orange)
summary(orange.lm)
plot(orange.lm$residuals ~ orange.lm$fitted.values)
```
You can search for \LaTeX\ mathematical commands. For example, if you search for `latex integrals', you will
be able to produce:
\begin{align}
\int_0^{\infty} e^{-x}\ dx &= \left.\left(-e^{-x}\right)\right|_0^{\infty} \nonumber\\
&= 0 -(-1) \nonumber\\
&= 1 \label{exp}
\end{align}
